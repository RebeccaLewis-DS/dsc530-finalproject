# The Impact of Leader Compensation and  Administrative Overhead on Fundraising Efficiency 
## DSC 530 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Final Project

The object of this project is to pose a question, evaluate a dataset to answer the question using exploratory data analysis techniques and provide a written and visual presentation of findings.

### Hypothesis
Many donors are unwilling to give to organizations with high paid leaders and higher administrative expenses in general. Changing the world unfortunately is not free and an investment is often required in staff and overhead to make an impact. The initial inspiration behind this project was to determine if leadership compensation and administrative expenses have an effect on an organizationâ€™s fundraising success. Do the dollars invested behind the scenes increase the ability of nonprofits to make an impact 
on the people they serve? Are larger organizations more efficient at raising money than smaller organizations simply because they can pay their staff better?
